# Dental Panoramic X-ray Tooth Numbering

This repository contains the code and resources for training a YOLOv8 model to perform tooth numbering on dental panoramic X-ray images using the FDI system.

## Project Steps:

1.  **Dataset Loading and Unzipping**: The dataset, provided as a zip file (`ToothNumber_TaskDataset.zip`), was uploaded and unzipped to a local directory (`dataset`).
2.  **Dataset Copy**: A copy of the original dataset (`dataset_copy`) was created to perform cleaning and splitting without altering the original data.
3.  **Label File Cleaning**: Invalid annotation rows (those not following the 5-value YOLO format) were removed from the label files in `dataset_copy`.
4.  **Dataset Splitting**: The cleaned dataset (`dataset_copy`) was split into training (80%), validation (10%), and testing (10%) sets. The image and corresponding label files were copied into separate directories (`dataset_split/train`, `dataset_split/val`, `dataset_split/test`).
5.  **Data Configuration**: A `data.yaml` file was created to configure the dataset paths and class names for YOLO training, following the FDI tooth numbering system.
6.  **Environment Setup**: Necessary libraries, including `ultralytics`, were installed using `pip`. A `requirements.txt` file was generated to list the project dependencies.
7.  **Model Training**: A YOLOv8s model was trained on the prepared dataset using pretrained weights.
8.  **Model Evaluation**: The trained model was evaluated on the validation and test sets to assess its performance. Key metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP@50, mAP@50-95) and visualizations (Confusion Matrix, Training Curves, Sample Predictions) were generated.
9.  **Post-Processing (Optional)**: (Include details here if you implemented and want to mention the post-processing logic for anatomical correctness).
